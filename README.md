# dsotm-canvas
The Dark Side Of The Moon Html5 Canvas POC

## Getting Started
Just clone this repo and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Motivation
Some time ago I decided to take a look at the Canvas API.

But drawing disconnected lines, did not motivate me for a POC.

So, why not draw the Dark Side of The Moon album cover using it?

Did you like it? Want to make any improvements? A jQuery plugin to ```$.dsotmIt()```? Feel free to go ahead. It's open source!
